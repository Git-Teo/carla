  # - CLASSES ------------------------------

  classes:
  - class_name: WorldSnapshot
    # - DESCRIPTION ------------------------
    doc: >
      This snapshot comprises all the information for every actor on scene at a certain moment of time. It creates and gives acces to a data structure containing a series of carla.ActorSnapshot. The client recieves a new snapshot on every tick that cannot be stored.  
    # - PROPERTIES -------------------------
    instance_variables:
    - var_name: id
      type: int
      doc: >
        A value unique for every snapshot to differenciate them. 
    - var_name: frame
      type: int
      doc: >
        Simulation frame in which the snapshot was taken. 
    - var_name: timestamp
      type: carla.Timestamp
      doc: >
         Precise moment in time when snapshot was taken. This class works in seconds as given by the operative system. 
    # - METHODS ----------------------------
    methods:
    - def_name: find
      return: carla.ActorSnapshot
      params: 
        - param_name: actor_id
          type: int
      doc: > 
        Given a certain actor ID, returns its corresponding snapshot or <b>None</b> if it is not found. 
    # --------------------------------------
    - def_name: has_actor
      return: bool
      params:
        - param_name: actor_id
          type: int
      doc: >
        Given a certain actor ID, checks if there is a snapshot corresponding it and so, if the actor was present at that moment.
